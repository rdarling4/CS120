	<h2>Recent Trip</h2>
	<p>
		Last year, I traveled to Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the first time. The mountains were gorgeous and all of the wildlife was incredible.
		I saw lots of bison and bears, a moose, elk, and a bald eagle. I went rafting down a river, visited Yellowstone, hiked, and went to the rodeo.
		I loved visiting so much and can't wait to go back, it's a really magical place.
	</p>

	<h2>My Favorite Pet Names</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A dog named Rosie</li>
		<li>A cat named Chicken</li>
		<li>A fish named Paul</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
	<p>
		One of my favorite restaurants is 
		<a href="https://bacarorestaurant.net/" target="_blank">Bacaro</a> in Providence, RI.
		The ambience is amazing, the food is incredible, and the service is unmatched.
		The wine-selection is extensive and the cocktails are classic but perfect.
		The baked pink pasta is to die for, as well as the scallops and celery salad.
		The menu changes frequently with whatever is in season locally and the ingredients are top-notch.
	</p>

	<h2>Favorite Food</h2>
	<img src="images/sushi.jpg" align="left" width="200">
	<p>
		My favorite food is sushi, specifically spicy tuna rolls and tamago nigiri.
		When I prepare it myself, I like to make the rolls small rather than thick and enjoy trying to make it inside-out style with the rice on the outside.
		I eat it with lots of soy sauce and sometimes spicy mayo.
